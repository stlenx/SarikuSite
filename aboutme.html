                                I just like to make stuff that does stuff, whether its a redstone contraption or a application it's just fun and very rewarding.
                                So far i haven't finished a lot of projects, but i like to blame that to my low creativity to come up with ideas for them. I am from Spain, Galicia.
                                Hated English for the most part of my life until not so long ago it just entered my brain thanks to the internet. I'm passionate about tech and languages
                                (even tho i'm too lazy to study hard).<br>
                                <br>
                                I am also highly interested in the vr industry. I have been following it since the oculus dk1 and even thought it took me a while to be able to afford a headset,
                                eventually i was able to buy a humble hp windows mixed reality. Since then i've had the rift s and now the valve index, also with fbt. New trackers are set to
                                come out soon and I'm waiting impatiently for a newer headset to come out and beat the index :)
